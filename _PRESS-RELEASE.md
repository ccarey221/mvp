There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Find Your Belongings

## Sub-Heading ##
  > If you've lost or found anything, post it on our site so that people can get their belongings back.

## Summary ##
  > Our site will provide customers an easy way to find the belongings they've lost. The customers will be able to offer rewards for their belongings. Once their belonging has been found, the finder may contact the customer to exchange their belonging for the reward.

## Problem ##
  > How can we connect people who have lost belongings with people that have found their belongings?

## Solution ##
  > Through photos of the missing items, people can identify their belongings. Only the customers who have lost the item may post pictures requesting other's contact them with their belonging, thus removing the possibility of other users claiming items that do not belong to them.

## Quote from You ##
  > Items can be worth far more than their monetary value. Connecting items with their owners can be far more meaningful than simply saving money.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply type in what you've lost 'i.e. 'watch'' and post a picture that proves that you are the owner of the lost item.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I lost my dog a few days ago and posted a picture of me with Fido on 'Find Your Belongings'. Within 24 hours I was reunited with Fido and gave the gentleman who found him a handsome reward!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Now that you know what Find Your Belongings is all about, go and find your lost belongings!
